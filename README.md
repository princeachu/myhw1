# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

In this project I took existing code and refactored it to either meet a certain set of standards and ensure Web accessibility.I accomplished this by replacing non sematic HTML tags like div with semantic HTML tags like nav where appropriate as well as implementing alt tags for each of the images on the page. I also fixed any links that were not working properly. 

## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
